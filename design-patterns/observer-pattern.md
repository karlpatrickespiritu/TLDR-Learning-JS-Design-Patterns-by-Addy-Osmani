### Observer Pattern

For complete reference, click [here](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#observerpatternjavascript).

### TL;DR

The Observer is a design pattern where an object (known as a subject) maintains a list of objects depending on it (observers), automatically notifying them of any changes to state.

When a subject needs to notify observers about something interesting happening, it broadcasts a notification to the observers (which can include specific data related to the topic of the notification).

When we no longer wish for a particular observer to be notified of changes by the subject they are registered with, the subject can remove them from the list of observers.
